### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

#### ðŸ’» What I'm working on...

During office hours I'm building software and services in the context of large-scale storage systems at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
Some of that work is open-source:

 * WebDAV server software based on Apache HTTPD for data access and transfer.
   Most projects are open-sourced at [Helmholtz's GitLab](https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/kit-scc-sdm/onlinestorage/httpd-webdav).
 * Tools supporting system operations:
   * [lsdf-checksum](https://github.com/pskopnik/lsdf-checksum) computes file content checksums to verify integrity.

At other times, I'm playing with technology and tend to over-engineer software to marginally improve my life ðŸ˜¬.

#### ðŸ”­ What I'm interested in...

Quite a few topics in the technology space I've been following for some time:

 * Data Storage and Processing (Databases, Processing and Analysis Engines, Workflow Systems, Programming Models and Paradigms, ...)
 * Deployment and Operations of Software Application (Orchestration Systems, GitOps, Monitoring, ...)
 * Distributed Systems (Network Protocols, Distributed System Architecture, Consensus Protocols, CRDTs, CAP, Caching, ...)
 * Building Engineering Organisations (Communication, Processes, Culture & Peopleware, Planning, ...)
