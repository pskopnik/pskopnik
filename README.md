### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

#### ðŸ’» What I'm working on...

During office hours I'm building firm real-time applications at Tripleye, a 3D sensing deep-tech.
I lead the design of our common domain layer libraries, making orchestrating and controlling multi-node systems from Python a breeze.
And am engaged with our skilled algorithm devs to ensure our C++ data-layer framework is as robust and efficient as possible.

Some of my work done previously in the context of large-scale storage systems at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology is open-source:

 * WebDAV server software based on Apache HTTPD for data access and federated transfer, open-sourced at [Helmholtz's GitLab](https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/kit-scc-sdm/onlinestorage/httpd-webdav).
 * [lsdf-checksum](https://github.com/pskopnik/lsdf-checksum) computes file content checksums to verify data integrity.

At other times, I'm playing with technology and tend to over-engineer software to marginally improve my life ðŸ˜¬.

#### ðŸ”­ What I'm interested in...

Quite a few topics in the technology space I've been following for some time:

 * Data Storage and Processing (Databases, Processing and Analysis Engines, Workflow Systems, Programming Models and Paradigms, ...)
 * Deployment and Operations of Software Application (Orchestration Systems, GitOps, Monitoring, ...)
 * Distributed Systems (Network Protocols, Distributed System Architecture, Consensus Protocols, CRDTs, CAP, Caching, ...)
 * Building Engineering Organisations (Communication, Processes, Culture & Peopleware, Planning, ...)
